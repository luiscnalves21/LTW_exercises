                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Francesinha is a sandwich from northern Portugal, especially the Porto
                    region. It has two slices of bread and various meats, covered with melted
                    cheese and served with sauce and fries. The sauce is a unique part of the
                    sandwich, with each restaurant having its own recipe made from tomatoes,
                    broth, piri piri spices, beer, and Port wine.

                    It's not an everyday dish, but it's worth trying at least once in your life. If you visit Porto, make sure to try a francesinha.
